**Title**: Feat: improve logging functionality

**Description**:

#### Implemented Changes:

* Refactored logging system to use a configurable log level (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).

#### Notes:

* Currently, no file-based logging is implemented - logs only output to console.
* Error handling for misconfigured log levels is minimal and should be improved later.
